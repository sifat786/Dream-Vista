- ## Setup

To setup the project you have to execute the command below:

1. At first you have to install all package. For this you Have to execute the command:

```sh
npm i
```

2. After install all package you need to run your project. But you can't run your project directly. Because I use environment variabel for security purpose. You have to add a `.env` file in your root directory and the a sample code of `.env` file are given below:

```.env
VITE_apiKey=*******************
VITE_authDomain=***************

```

The first six api key you will get form firebase & and the last api key you will get from ImgBB.

3. After setting environment variable you can run or build your project.

```sh
npm run dev
